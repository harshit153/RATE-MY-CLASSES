        contents: "Pros: Teaches you “computational thinking”, being the ability to understand how a program works down to each variable. Dives deep into concepts like functional programming and recursion in a deeper manner than other collegiate introductory courses that really tests your ability to think. The lectures are brilliant and the material is extremely well documented and organized. The projects were fun and were a good application of the materials taught Cons: Does not cover topics such as how a computer works internally, bits, and subjects on a more “machine level” that you might expect; the course tends to be more high level focused. There is an extremely high jump in difficulty from the homework/projects and the test. Studying from the lectures will not work; you need to grind previous exams due to an innate difference in the style of coding (homework let you experiment with multiple solutions or use visualizers, paper exams forces you to perfectly understand the logic & transcribe onto paper). Also, may not accurately represent what it might be like to have a career in computer science due to its theoretical nature (so don’t give up!)"
